The aim of this project is to be simple yet complete.

The initial idea was (and still is) to have fun by writing a program for
something that I would do for myself using an Excel or Calc sheet.

## Description

The application consists of 7 tabs:

- Dashboard: where you login/logoff and see consolidated information.
- Expenses and revenues: where you manage your money flow. It's the money you
get (incomes), the money you spend (expenses), the money you lend to other
people (loans) and the money you transfer to investments (investments).
- Budget: manage predictions of your money flow in the next months.
- Investments: take care of your investments in a simple, straightforward way.
- Statistics: if you are that type of person, you have easy access many 
statistics.
- Strategy: investment allocation plan, which is similar to the idea of the
budget.
- Settings: manage everything here, from your account settings to customizing
categories.
