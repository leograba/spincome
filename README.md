# My own finance manager

This is a personal project that aims to be fun and make something I would do for
myself using an Excel or Calc sheet. I like the idea of making my own manager my
own way - feedback is welcome, but don't expect me to change ideas easily.

## ToDo list

- Data input validation
- Transfer all DB logic to a separate file
- Make a login kind of stuff work
- Understand how application icon works
- Use the right console.something() instead of always console.log() and add file
and function name
