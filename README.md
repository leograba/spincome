# My own finance manager

This is a personal project that aims to be fun and make something I would do for
myself using an Excel or Calc sheet.

## ToDo list

- Data input validation
- Understand how application icon works --> low prio
- Use the right console.something() instead of always console.log() and add file
and function name
- Currently uses the last rowid to position current selection, if I remember
right. This is a bad idea if entries are removed from the DB.
- Add the delete feature to the exp/rev page.
- Standardize error handling - throw, console.error(), console.trace(), etc
- Check Javascript code-behind vs shared library --> this works well
- Create a dashboard with the following information:
* How much do I have until the selected date
* How much do I have invested
* Yield rate for the previous month
* Budget vs expense
